You probably have to pre-fill the slave output buffer with one byte 
(0x00) to have this byte being sent out on MISO out while transmitting 
the command byte.
Also you have to make sure the slave is able to process the command byte 
fast enough to load the 4-byte answer into the output buffer before the 
9th bit clock cycle occurs.
Maybe a short delay between end of command byte and clocking in MISO 
data is necessary here.
